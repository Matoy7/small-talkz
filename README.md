Small-talkz is a chat application that allows anyone to start a conversation with.. well anyone who is online on the app. 

A user can open a conversation with a certain topic and wait for someone to join in, or to join an existing conversation based on the topic he wants.

A user can be risky and random a conversation to join into.

Unlike other social network you don't necessary need to know the person you are talking to. The whole point is to meet and find new people to talk to.

The app is built in MEAN (the combination mongodb express angular and node js).


There is also a server which being deployed automaticly when code is pushed into the git repo on: small-talkz.herokuapp.com

And also online mongodb server on: mlab.com/databases/small-talkz

The code itseld is a singe page application model in angular.

Q/A:

 - How to load the app:
1. pull the content from our github-repo
2. npm install
3. npm start

- What do you need contributors to do?

Anything they can. :)

And more seriously, we need code reviewers, css experts, angular best practice people, designers, but if you just have a good advice we are more then ready to take it and we will be forever grateful.

What about feature backlog? what more you need to implement?

We are working on it at the moment.

Thanks
